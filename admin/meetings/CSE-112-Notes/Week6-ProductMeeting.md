# Meeting Notes

### Domain - Miro Board - Journal explanation

- Base template is that there are future logs daily logs and multi logs
- They are all in a collection
- Future is long periods of time, i.e. spring quarter
    - Several monthly logs
    - within each month there is a set of daily logs
- There are also logs that have nothing to do with the three sets of base templates
    - Exist in just a collection
- We want to be able to see everything we put into the future log and be able to move them over.
    - This is one of the most complex things
- Everything else is just A BULLET, and we have three different bullet types
    - Each bullet will also be able to use SIGNIFIERS, could be anything they create their own
    - in principle this is supposed to be fast and concise

### Components 

- Main page always has your daily page up
- Rethink future logs, but should present with all
- So Trackers are basically, markers that you hit off on each daily log. Such as saying you want to brush your teeth everyday. And you put that in your tracker and it says that each day you have to mark it off
- Creating a card component
- Sidebar componen t

### Unit Tests

- Revamping the Entire Application
- Need to get the doc for how to write tests
- Need ADR and Guidelines
    - Guidelines need to have a certain amount of coverage
- Mostly Need E2E tests on the home, will happen when we build more
